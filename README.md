# QR_comptaBDD
This is a protocol to sort a data financial excel and to rend plots. It is done with Python, in Anaconda, using the Pandas library. 

## Set up the environment
1. You have to install Anaconda environment.
2. Then, you have to install Jupyter Lab.
3. When it's done, just go to my instruction file and run one by one each block of code.
